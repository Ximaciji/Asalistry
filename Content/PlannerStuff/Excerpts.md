# Asalinism Excerpts

Yonah and Yaara, twin brother and sister, were tree nymphs. After the Temporis Kingdom burned the forests, Yonah and Yaara were taken back to the Jungle Temple. The Temporisans would put their prisoners against the Golem for entertainment. Yaara was forced to watch as her brother, Yonah, was easily slaughtered. She went on a rampage and massacred the Temporis people. She fled deeper into the jungle until stumbling upon the realm of hell, where she painfully died due to the heat.

Chrystal was a demi-spirit who liked to explore caves. Crystallite Armor was a commodity amongst the demi-spirits of the hallowed caves, but one had to have a great deal of money to make Kryos Bars to meld Crystallite Armor into Kreustalline Armor. Chrystal soon joined the Kaldren Military in order to fund her cave exploration. During the battle against the Dommers, she used her Kreustalline armor to repair her given hallowed battle armor.

Tsafaara is an engineer-hobbyist of the Pyrani lands. Tsafaara’s family did not live in a money-driven society. They were rich— in that they had each other, had more than enough to survive, and had days of relaxation. When Broga and Ursine, the king and queen of Kaldre, arrived in the desert, they stole the resources of the Pyranians and constructed the pyramids, where the locals were forced to trade the goods they had, collected, or stole, with the goods that the Kaldrens took. Tsafaara’s family was robbed by neighbors and passers until they had no more to trade. In order to feed his family, Tsafaara joined the Kaldren Military.

The Dommers were peoples of the meadows. The many different peoples were very harmonious as they often circulated resources between the ocean, their land, and the neighboring lands. Mining for minerals uncovered the underground hallowed biome, where circulation extended and continued. Wanting to expand, the Kaldren Empire made a deal with the Dommers. The Kaldrens would protect the Dommers if they traded with the Kaldrens. The Dommers took the deal, seeing as they were already trading and circulating. The Kaldrens commissioned Tsafaara’s team to construct the Dungeon, a border between the Dommers and any potential threat. After the completion of the Dungeon, a Kaldren Fleet, ordered by Chrystal, was ordered to slaughter and imprison the Dommers into the Dungeon.
